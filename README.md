# ParkAPI
National park API, were users can Get, Create, Update and Delete national parks they have visited and the trails in those parks they have completed. It was created using .NET core 3.1 and SQL Server for database, along with Entity framework core. I Have used DTOs for this API, so i will have full control over the attributes I am receiving when creating and updating a resource.  SwashBuckle/Swagger was used to create the documentation for API.
